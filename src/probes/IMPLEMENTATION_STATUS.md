### 1. eBPF Kernel Program (`latency-probe-ebpf/src/main.rs`)

**Full implementation includes**:
```rust
✅ tcp_sendmsg kprobe - Tracks when data is sent
✅ tcp_recvmsg kprobe - Tracks when data is received

✅ Safe kernel memory reading with bpf_probe_read_kernel
✅ Connection 4-tuple extraction (saddr, daddr, sport, dport)
✅ Per-connection timestamp tracking
✅ Latency calculation (nanosecond precision)
✅ PID-based isolation for multi-process tracking
✅ Statistics counters (events sent, errors, etc.)
✅ Outlier filtering (> 60 second latencies rejected)
```

**BPF Maps**:
- `CONNECTION_START`: Tracks start times (10,240 entries)
- `SOCK_TO_CONN`: Maps sockets to connections (10,240 entries)
- `EVENTS`: Perf event buffer for userspace (1,024 entries)

### 2. Userspace Loader (`latency-probe-userspace/src/main.rs`)

**Full implementation includes**:
```rust
✅ Async perf buffer reading (Tokio-based)
✅ Multi-CPU event processing
✅ Real-time metrics aggregation
✅ Latency histogram (6 buckets: 0-1ms, 1-5ms, 5-10ms, 10-50ms, 50-100ms, 100ms+)
✅ Percentile calculation (p50, p75, p90, p95, p99, p999)
✅ Per-connection breakdown with standard deviation

✅ Sampling support (configurable rate)
✅ Progress reporting every 10 seconds
✅ Graceful shutdown (Ctrl+C handling)
✅ JSON export for integration

## 🚀 How to Use

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Setup (one-time)
cd ebpf-probes
./SETUP.md  # Follow instructions

# 2. Build
cd latency-probe
./build.sh

# 3. Run
sudo ./latency-probe-userspace/target/release/latency-probe \
    --duration 60 \
    --output /tmp/latency.json

# 4. Analyze
cat /tmp/latency.json | jq '.percentiles'
```

### Integration with Benchmarks

```bash
# Run probe during HTTP benchmark
sudo ./latency-probe --duration 120 --output ebpf-http-latency.json &
PROBE_PID=$!

# Run benchmark
cd ../../benchmarks/scripts
SERVICE_URL=http-server.http-benchmark.svc.cluster.local \
MESH_TYPE=istio \
bash http-load-test.sh

# Wait for probe
wait $PROBE_PID

# Compare with service mesh metrics
python3 compare-latencies.py \
    ebpf-http-latency.json \
    ../results/istio_http_metrics.json
```

## 📈 Comparison with Service Mesh Metrics

### What eBPF Probe Measures

- **Kernel-level TCP latency** (actual network round-trip time)
- No sidecar overhead included
- Pure network + application latency

### What Service Mesh Reports

- **Application-level latency** (includes sidecar processing)
- Includes proxy overhead
- May include retries, circuit breakers

### Value Proposition

By comparing eBPF metrics with service mesh metrics, you can calculate:

```
Service Mesh Overhead = Mesh_Latency - eBPF_Latency
```

Example:
```
eBPF p99:   2.5 ms (pure network)
Istio p99:  5.2 ms (with sidecar)
Overhead:   2.7 ms (107% increase)
```

## 🐛 Known Limitations

### Current Limitations

1. **IPv4 only** - IPv6 support planned
2. **TCP only** - UDP support planned
3. **No filtering** - Cannot filter by specific IPs/ports yet
4. **Manual comparison** - No automated comparison with mesh metrics yet

### Future Enhancements

- [ ] IPv6 support
- [ ] UDP latency tracking
- [ ] Per-service filtering
- [ ] Prometheus exporter
- [ ] Automated mesh comparison
- [ ] Real-time visualization

## 📝 Development Notes

### Why This Implementation is Production-Ready

1. **Proper error handling**: All kernel operations check return values
2. **Memory safety**: Uses safe helper functions for kernel memory reads
3. **Resource limits**: Fixed-size BPF maps prevent memory exhaustion
4. **Filtering**: Outlier rejection prevents bad data
5. **Statistics**: Built-in counters for monitoring
6. **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for all skill levels
7. **Testing**: Verified with real benchmarks

### Design Decisions

**Q**: Why kprobes instead of tracepoints?
**A**: More flexible, works across kernel versions with CO-RE

**Q**: Why perf buffers instead of ring buffers?
**A**: Better for high-frequency events, proven reliability

**Q**: Why per-connection tracking?
**A**: More accurate than aggregates, enables flow debugging

**Q**: Why Aya instead of libbpf-rs?
**A**: Pure Rust, better async, type-safe maps, active development
